# DataAnalytics2024_Jake_Lorenzo_Assignment_5


Part 1:
A. Describe the type of patterns or trends you might look for and how you plan to explore 
and model them. (Min. 3 sentences)

B. Perform exploratory data analysis (variable distributions, etc.) and describe what you 
did including plots and other descriptions. Identify the outlier values in the data for Sale 
Price and generate suitable plots to demonstrate the outliers relative to the other data 
points. (Min. 5 sentences) 

C. Conduct Multivariate Regression on the 1 borough dataset to predict the Sale Price 
using other variables that may have a meaningful connection to price. After you identify a 
well-performing model test it on 2 subsets of 1 borough dataset (based on meaningful 
criteria of your choice, such as building class or sq footage value) and compare the results 
you obtained. You may have to try multiple models and drop variables with very low 
significance. Explain the results. (Min. 5 sentences) 

D. Pick more than one supervised learning model (these need not be restricted to the 
models you’ve learned so far), e.g., Naïve Bayes, k-NN, Random Forest, SVM to explore a 
classification problem using the data. You may choose which categorical variable (e.g. 
neighborhood, building class) to use as class label. Evaluate the results (contingency 
tables & metrics). Describe any cleaning you had to do and why. (Min. 5 sentences)

Part 2:

A. Apply the best performing regression model(s) from 1.c to predict Sale Price based on 
the variables you chose. Plot the predictions and residuals. Explain how well (or not) the 
models generalize to the whole dataset and speculate as to the reason. (Min. 3-4 sentences)

B. Apply the classification model(s) from 1.d to predict the categorical variable of your 
choice. Evaluate the results (contingency tables & metrics). Explain how well (or not) the 
models generalize to the whole dataset and speculate as to the reason. (Min. 3-4 sentences)

C.  Discuss any observations you had about the datasets/ variables, other data in the 
dataset and/or your confidence in the result. (Min 1-2 sentences)

Part 3 (Grad Level):
Draw conclusions from this study – about the model type and 
suitability/ deficiencies. Describe what worked and why/ why not. (Min. 6-7 sentences)
